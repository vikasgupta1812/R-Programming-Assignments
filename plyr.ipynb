    "It epitomizes the “split-apply-combine” method of data manipulation. The core of plyr consists of functions such as ddply, llply and ldply. All of the manipulation functions consist of five letters, with the last three always being ply. The first letter indicates the type of input and the second letter indicates the type of output. For instance, ddply takes in a data.frame and outputs a data.frame, llply takes in a list and outputs a list and ldply takes in a list and outputs a data.frame.\n",
